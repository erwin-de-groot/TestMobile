This project contains the 'game engine'. It compiles to a .NET standard 2.0 library, 
which means any application build on top of a .NET framework supporting .NET standard 2.0
can use this library (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard 
for a list of available frameworks).

For this Solution, the ButtonGame project serves to illustrate how a .NET library can be 
written once and be used for several different platforms.
